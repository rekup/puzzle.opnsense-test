# Opnsense Collection for Ansible

[![CI](https://github.com/puzzle/puzzle.opnsense/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/puzzle/puzzle.opnsense/actions) [![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/puzzle/puzzle.opnsense)](https://codecov.io/gh/puzzle/puzzle.opnsense)

The Ansible Collection for OPNsense provides a comprehensive set of Ansible content to automate the configuration and
management of OPNsense instances. It offers a streamlined approach to deploy and maintain OPNsense firewalls and routing
platforms in a scalable and consistent manner.

## Using this collection

<!--Include some quick examples that cover the most common use cases for your collection content. It can include the following examples of installation and upgrade (change puzzle.opnsense correspondingly):-->

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install puzzle.opnsense
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it
with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: puzzle.opnsense
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade
the `ansible` package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install puzzle.opnsense --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is
broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax to install
version `0.1.0`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install puzzle.opnsense:==0.1.0
```

See [Ansible using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more
details.
